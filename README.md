# Machine-Learning-Project

### Overview

This repository contains the culmination of my efforts in the Machine Learning course at University College Dublin (UCD). This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world classification task, specifically classifying news articles into distinct topical categories.

### Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Understanding 
Download and load the dataset: The dataset provided is a subset of a larger dataset containing news articles categorized into two classes.
Explore the data: Analyze the most common terms for each category, consider text preprocessing, analyze other features, and check for data quality issues.
### Task 2: Data Preparation & Modeling 
Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Save them as separate CSV files.
Preprocess the data: Create a numeric representation of the documents suitable for classification. Apply necessary text preprocessing techniques and explain your choices.
Build binary classification models: Develop classifiers using two classifiers from week 1. Comment on your choices and parameters.
Implement an end-to-end deep learning classifier: Train a deep learning model from scratch or fine-tune an existing model.
### Task 3: Evaluation
Choose a primary metric: Select a primary metric for model evaluation and justify your choice.
Evaluate models: Measure the performance of models developed in Task 2 on train and validation sets. Compare performance and analyze classifiers/models.
Error analysis: Perform error analysis for each model. Identify common misclassifications and lessons learned.
Apply changes to models: Make changes to models based on error analysis and reevaluate. Comment on your choices and results.
Cross-validation: Perform cross-validation on the best model from Task 3.
Test set evaluation: Apply the best model to the test set and compare results with validation set. Comment on the outcome.
Model retraining: Retrain the best model using combined train and validation sets and test on the test set. Analyze the impact of additional data.

This project represents my practical application of machine learning concepts and methodologies in solving a real-world problem. It demonstrates my ability to explore data, develop models, evaluate their performance, and make informed decisions based on the results.
